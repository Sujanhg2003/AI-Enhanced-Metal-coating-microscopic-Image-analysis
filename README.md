### AI-Enhanced-Metal-coating-microscopic-Image-analysis

## Introduction
#### The AI-based Metal Coating Microscopic Image Analysis project focuses on automating the analysis of metal coating cross-sections to study the characteristics of undissolved and dissolved particles. This innova- tive solution integrates traditional image processing techniques with modern deep learning methodologies to provide an accurate, efficient, and scalable approach for analyzing microscopic images.The traditional image processing solution utilizes advanced techniques such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Histogram Equalization for image enhancement, along with super- pixel algorithms and denoising methods to address challenges like discontinuous boundaries and noise. These methods enable precise segmentation of undissolved white particles and the calculation of their area ratios, contributing to quality control and process optimization in metal coating applications.For the deep learning solution, a UNet segmentation model with ResNet as the backbone was trained using segmentation outputs generated by the traditional methods. This model enhances the automation process by accurately identifying and segmenting regions of interest in microscopic images. A user-friendly interface developed using Streamlit further enables detailed analyses such as calculating the fraction of melted and unmelted regions, the size and aspect ratio of unmelted pores, and their height and width.By combining traditional and modern approaches, this project offers a comprehensive tool for the metallur- gical department, automating the tedious and time-consuming analysis performed using ImageJ software. It significantly improves efficiency and accuracy in analyzing metal coatings, providing valuable insights for research, quality assurance, and industrial process optimization.

## Related Work
#### The analysis of microscopic images in material science has been extensively explored using both traditional image pro- cessing and deep learning techniques. Traditional methods, such as Histogram Equalization, CLAHE, and denoising filters, have proven effective in enhancing image quality and segmenting specific features like particles or pores in metal coatings. However, these methods often struggle with complex patterns, noise, and variability in datasets. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with architec- tures like UNet and ResNet backbones, have significantly improved segmentation accuracy and generalizability. These approaches excel in handling noisy and intricate images, offering robust solutions for tasks like material characteri- zation. This project builds upon these established techniques, integrating the strengths of both traditional and modern meth- ods to achieve superior segmentation and analysis outcomes tailored to metallurgical applications.

### IMAGE ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES
#### In the context of microscopic image analysis, enhancing image quality is crucial for improving the visibility of key features, particularly when dealing with low-contrast images. Two commonly used techniques for image quality enhance- ment are Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Histogram Equalization. Both methods are designed to enhance the contrast of images but operate in different ways, each with its unique advantages.

#### 1)	Histogram Equalization
#### Histogram Equalization is a fundamental image processing technique used to improve the contrast of an image. It works by redistributing the intensity values of the pix- els in an image so that they span the full range of possible values. This redistribution is done by modifying the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the image histogram, leading to a more uniform intensity distribution.The histogram of an image represents the distribution of pixel intensity values.In a low-contrast image, the his- togram is often narrow and concentrated in a specific in- tensity range.Histogram Equalization spreads out the most frequent intensity values, thereby enhancing the contrast of the image.The transformation function is derived from the cumulative histogram, mapping the input intensity levels to new output levels that have a uniform distribution across the available intensity range.
