### AI-Enhanced-Metal-coating-microscopic-Image-analysis

## Introduction
#### The AI-based Metal Coating Microscopic Image Analysis project focuses on automating the analysis of metal coating cross-sections to study the characteristics of undissolved and dissolved particles. This innova- tive solution integrates traditional image processing techniques with modern deep learning methodologies to provide an accurate, efficient, and scalable approach for analyzing microscopic images.The traditional image processing solution utilizes advanced techniques such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Histogram Equalization for image enhancement, along with super- pixel algorithms and denoising methods to address challenges like discontinuous boundaries and noise. These methods enable precise segmentation of undissolved white particles and the calculation of their area ratios, contributing to quality control and process optimization in metal coating applications.For the deep learning solution, a UNet segmentation model with ResNet as the backbone was trained using segmentation outputs generated by the traditional methods. This model enhances the automation process by accurately identifying and segmenting regions of interest in microscopic images. A user-friendly interface developed using Streamlit further enables detailed analyses such as calculating the fraction of melted and unmelted regions, the size and aspect ratio of unmelted pores, and their height and width.By combining traditional and modern approaches, this project offers a comprehensive tool for the metallur- gical department, automating the tedious and time-consuming analysis performed using ImageJ software. It significantly improves efficiency and accuracy in analyzing metal coatings, providing valuable insights for research, quality assurance, and industrial process optimization.
